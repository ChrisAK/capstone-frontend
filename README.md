# Pokemon Team Planner
### By: Chris Kennelly

## Welcome to my Project!

This Planner was made to allow people to plan what they wanted their teams to be when playing through a pokemon game. I know that I like to go back and play through the games again and I would definitely like a way to plan out my run before I do it.

By the end of this project there were still a few things I wanted to do, specifically, using the data more and being able to show people the weaknesses of their teams and help them make better choices for their runs. Also, being able to look at other peoples' teams and compare yours to theirs would be a fun stretch goal to hit.
